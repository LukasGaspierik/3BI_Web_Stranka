                        <p>We started this project to help non-professionals visualize their future homes with simple tools. Coming from years of experience in design software development and architecture, we realized that not everybody could have the means to commission an agency or time to make proper research of who to hire.   We managed to bring the functionality from the best industry design tools into our platform. In just a few years, we’ve grown from a small start-up with a few enthusiasts to a robust service with over 64 millions of users and more than 300 million interior design projects created.</p>
